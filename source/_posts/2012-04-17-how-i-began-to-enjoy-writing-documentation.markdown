I find writing documentation to be a soul-sucking, tedious activity. And I was dragging my feet on getting started on my task at hand last week.

So, I spent a few hours setting up [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) on my test machine, and now I get to play with a new (to me) technology and language (markup) instead of daydreaming whilst documenting away!

Plus, I love [sublime text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)'s support for sftp and markdown (along with so many more technologies)
