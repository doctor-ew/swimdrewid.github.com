### People of Earth. How are you? ###

I really have nothing to say on a blog. I just wanted to see how difficult it was to install ruby, rvm, jekyll and octopress and then CNAME github to a custom subdomain.

Not certain I like the fact that I lost my CNAME this a.m. And then had to recompile octopress.

Nor am I certain that I have the whole git push to <https://github.com/swimdrewid/swimdrewid.github.com> down.

But, at least I got this far!
